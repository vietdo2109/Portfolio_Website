          >. This personal project served as a sandbox to explore and implement
          features I found useful for work while practicing new technologies. I
          gained valuable experience integrating full-stack features such as
          authentication, CRUD operations, and interactive tools like a Pomodoro
          clock, quiz system, and AI chatbot using Google‚Äôs Gemini model via
          Vercel AI SDK. I also worked with schema validation libraries (Yup,
          Joi, Zod), React Hook Form, and optimized data fetching with React
          Query. This project gave me deeper understanding of building
          real-world dashboards, managing app data with RESTful APIs, and
          enhancing user experience through responsive UI using Chakra UI and
          Next.js.</app-white-text
