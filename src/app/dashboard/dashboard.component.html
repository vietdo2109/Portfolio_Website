          >For 2 years, I prototyped new ways to engage with computer
          interfaces, mostly working with voice and AI. Brain was one of the
          first companies to explore the idea of multimodal, generative
          interfaces. My time working with the team has shaped many of the
          principles I design with now. Most of my work stayed in R&D but pieces
          of it have shipped and are now in the app storeâ†— .</app-white-text
