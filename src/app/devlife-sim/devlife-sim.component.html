          >For the final assignment in my Mobile Development course, I developed
          a DevLife Simulator mobile game using React Native. The game features
          basic authentication, data storage with Firebase, and a
          custom-designed 2D pixel art interface. This project deepened my
          understanding of mobile app architecture, especially around user flows
          and data management â€” and also taught me a valuable lesson about how
          misusing useEffect can quickly spiral into bugs and performance
          issues.</app-white-text
